                        the common core, and relationships for life. Our mission is to provide a safe, disciplined learning
                        environment that empowers all students to develop their full potential. We feel strongly about helping
                        to build leaders that have the ability to succeed in whatever endeavor they undertake. Winning is not
                        always the measure of success. Our students understand the "Win, win" philosophy and use it in their
                        daily life. Common standards keeps us focused on learning appropriate content and preparing our students
                        to graduate. Last but just as importantly, setting examples for our students of meaningful and lasting
                        relationships will go with them throughout their lifetime.Today, 2081-Bhadra-28, we would like to express
                        our heartfelt gratitude to the artist students who managed to secure second place in the Mahangal Ga Pa

                        "Hamro Samaj"and express our heartfelt gratitude to all the teachers who supported them.The basic
