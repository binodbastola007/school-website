                The basic purpose of narrative is to entertain, to gain and hold readers' interest. However, narratives can also be written to teach or inform, to change attitudes/social opinions.
                Narratives sequence people/characters in time and place but differ from recounts in that through the sequencing, the stories set up one or more problems, which must eventually find a way to be resolved.
